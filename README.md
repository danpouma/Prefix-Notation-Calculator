Print instructions explaining how to operate the calculator
Allow the user to continue entering calculations until they quit the program
Allow the user to perform the following operations:
	- add ( + ) should add to doubles 
	- subtract ( - )  should subtract to doubles
	- multiply ( * )  multiply two doubles
	- divide  ( / )  divide two doubles, do not allow division by zero
	- power ( ^ ) a double and an integer, calculate the double raised to the integer. zero and negative exponents should work.
	- exponential ( e ) raise the constant e to the power of the integer provided. zero and negative exponents should work. (you must define the constant)
	- factorial  ( ! ) given an integer, calculate the factorial. store your result as a long
	- random range ( r ) given two integers, generate a random integer between the two integers (inclusively). Be sure the lower bound is less than the upper bound
	- sum range ( s ) calculate the sum of consecutive integers between two given integers (inclusively)
	- round ( ~ ) given a double, round to the nearest integers
	- roundup ( ' ) given a double, round to the nearest integers
	- rounddown ( _ ) given a double, round to the nearest integers
	- minimum ( < ) given two doubles, determine the lesser
	- maximum ( > ) given two doubles, determine the greater
Allow the user to input the calculation all at once (examples below)
	+  3  4
	/  4.3  2.3
	^  3.1  2
	r  5  10
Your code must meet the following technical specifications
	- use at least two variables of different types
	- no global variables allowed
	- use a constant, global constants are ok
	- use at least one if or if else statement
	- use at least one switch statement
	- use at least one for loop
	- use at least one while or do while loop
	- use at least three functions with prototype.
	- at least one must return a value
	- at least one must take input
